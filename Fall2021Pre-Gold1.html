											For 1 hour I attended the weekly WolverineSoft Studio meeting. For this meeting I mainly talked with the Game Design department to go over how we felt our designs were, what we should look for in any future playtesting, and overall what we could do to help the project in its final days.

								</p>*</p>
							</p>PRE-GOLD 1 SPRINT RECAP:</p>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR THE PAST 1 WEEK:</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 15 Hours (for 5 Academic Credits 15 Hours Per Week, 15 Hours * 1 Week = 15 Hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint (Week): 30 Hours (? Hours from Pre-Gold 1 = ? Hours)</p>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>**Most of my evidence this week is in the form of photos or GIFs.<p>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED</p>
							</p>*Problem: Being busy with finals; I'm taking 20 credits and grading 2 classes this semester while working a part-time business job.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Finding a way to capture and observe itch.io rankings for our games the 48 hours after their releases.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Trying not to spam people too much the day during our game releases with social media and Discord announcements.</p>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*Solution: Prioritize tasks where others depend on me first (including WolverineSoft Studio), then tasks that will benefit me individually.</p>
							</p>*Solution: Capturing GIFs and photos like crazy after the 32 hour mark, then watching various game search categories on itch.io.</p>
							</p>*Solution: Space out posts throughout day, and use different social media platforms to not be annoying in one chat space for too long.</p>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Gathering itch.io rankings and organizing them on the WolverineSoft Studio Fall 2021 Airtable Workspace.</p>
							</p>*Gathering social media data and organizing it on the WolverineSoft Studio Fall 2021 Airtable Workspace.</p>
							</p>*Creating GIFs for the Ragnarok TD page. We got some pretty unique ones up there (my favorite--the one-life one! close second the 5-second wave one).</p>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*Trying to create more TikTok videos back-to-back-to-back. (Too many posts at once for that one)</p>
							</p>*Lack of time spent on HTML tutorials (still have much to learn with using HTML)</p>
							</p>*I still overall don't feel like too much of my time was wasted, especially as much of my work is creating long-term workflows, which means I might not have much immediate progress yet, yet I also think I got immediate progress this semester as well!</p>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Organizing social media schedule at beginning of each Sprint and having someone hold me accountable to stick to it.</p>
							</p>*Creating a similar Airtable (assuming Winter 2022) during Preproduction instead of Alpha 2 Sprint.</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research ideas (now for how to get the most views, impressions, and best algorithms for social medias)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website, overall cleaning up a lot of my work and further summarizing it.</p>
							</p>*Writing up my dev-blog entries DURING the sprints instead of waiting until the end (I do think I was better in Fall 2021 than Winter 2021 at this though).</p>
