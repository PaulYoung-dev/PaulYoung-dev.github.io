								<p>
		
								</p>
									<p>Pre-Gold 1: 9.5 Total Work Hours
										<p>*Apr. 4th - Monday: 0.5 Hours <br>
											I communicated with Spartasoft President and Spartasoft Studio Producer about a connection opportunity. I also saw their Spartasoft page and followed it (gotta keep the rivalry up!).

										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 5th - Tuesday: 1.25 Hours <br>
											From 11:30am - 12:00pm EST I connected Spartasoft President and Spartasoft Studio Producer with Full-Sail University graduate Game Designer who also went to MSU.
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Gold 1 (Apr. 4 - Apr. 10, 2022)/Screenshot (13083).png" alt="" /></span> 
											<br>
											From 7:00pm - 7:45pm EST I attended the Matt Rader playtest session for WolverineSoft Studio.

										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 6th - Wednesday: N/A
										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 7th - Thursday: 3 Hours Total <br>
											From 7:00pm - 9:00pm EST I attended the WolverineSoft general meeting. We were honored to hear Austin Yarger's new XR game-dev course prioritizing Unreal Engine and Perforce with more focus on social impacts than its Unity raw game-dev counterpart course that currently exists. Looks interesting!
											Additionally, we went over historic games in WolverineSoft's history which started in 1999. Some projects I've been involved with/witnessed firsthand were spoken about! It was also super cool to finally see the renowned
											Crisis Wolverine game! Additionally afterwards I attended the WolverineSoft officer meeting.

											<br>
											From 11:00pm - 12:00am EST I networked with some individuals to share the word more about our playtest list and to recruit someone from UC Berkeley for Bluebird Studios.

										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 8th - Friday: N/A
										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 9th - Saturday: 2.25 Hours Total <br>
											From 12:00pm - 2:15pm EST I created our Resume Book Consent form, asking for feedback from the Studio directors and our Advisor Austin Yarger for feedback. I
											told this news to several channels, and created announcement explaining what exactly a Resume Book is. I was careful in how I worded this so as to get form results
											quickly while explaining why we need it in a way so as to encourage people to take it rather than be suspicious of it (like "why would I provide my resume for this?"" type of thing).

										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 10th - Sunday: 2.5 Hours Total <br>
											From 4:00pm - 6:45pm EST I applied marketing and game-design skills I keep learning from WolverineSoft Studio with the Bluebird Studios project. We discussed several designs for the upcoming game, and afterwards I created a brief playtest demographics doc and then reached out to MPowered Entrepreneurship about it.

											If there was any other experiences of personal game-dev growth/WolverineSoft Studio work time this day I did not document it nor do I remember it.

								</p>*</p>
							</p>PRE-GOLD 1 SPRINT RECAP:</p>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR PRE-GOLD 1 SPRINT</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 12 Hours (for 5 Academic Credits 12 Hours Per Week, 12 Hours * 1 Week = 12 Hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint (Week): 9.5 Hours (9.5 Hours from Pre-Gold 1 = 9.5 Hours)</p>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>**Most of my evidence this week is in the form of photos.<p>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED</p>
							</p>*Problem: Being busy with finals; I'm taking 20 credits and grading 2 classes this semester while working a part-time business job.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Having trouble learning how to post with TikTok (have to use phone and computer for optimal results).</p>
							</p>*Problem: Desperately needing to get more social media content on our WolverineSoft Studio accounts.</p>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*Solution: Prioritize tasks where others depend on me first (including WolverineSoft Studio), then tasks that will benefit me individually.</p>
							</p>*Solution: Researched how to post with TikTok, didn't stop until got a clean looking post up.</p>
							</p>*Solution: Posted on multiple platforms (Linked, Twitter, and TikTok) across multiple days.</p>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Getting up a TikTok post and getting 500+ views and 20+ likes/hearts within 24 hours despite starting off with 0 Followers!</p>
							</p>*Posting on social media accounts throughout the week so each account (except Instagram and TikTok) have a decent amount of content on the profiles.</p>
							</p>*Recording the 20+ 5-second gameplay videos, turning them in by the date I said I would. That was much easier than I thought it would be.</p>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*A lot of my time was attending playtesting sessions (while informative I could've learned a lot about the current state of the games by playing them myself).</p>
							</p>*Several times logging into social media accounts, only to get sidetracked by some other task/class and not end up posting.</p>
							</p>*I still overall don't feel like too much of my time was wasted, especially as much of my work is creating long-term workflows, which means I might not have much immediate progress yet, yet I also think I got immediate progress this semester as well!</p>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Organizing social media schedule at beginning of each Sprint and having someone hold me accountable to stick to it.</p>
							</p>*Creating a similar Airtable (assuming Winter 2022) during Preproduction instead of Alpha 2 Sprint.</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research ideas (now for how to get the most views, impressions, and best algorithms for social medias)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website, overall cleaning up a lot of my work and further summarizing it.</p>
							</p>*Writing up my dev-blog entries DURING the sprints instead of waiting until the end (I do think I was better in Fall 2021 than Winter 2021 at this though).</p>
