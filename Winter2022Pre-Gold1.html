							</p>PRE-GOLD 1 SPRINT RECAP:</p>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR PRE-GOLD 1 SPRINT</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 15 Hours (for 5 Academic Credits 15 Hours Per Week, 15 Hours * 1 Week = 15 Hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint (Week): 15.75 Hours (15.75 Hours from Pre-Gold 1 = 15.75 Hours)</p>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>**Most of my evidence this week is in the form of photos or GIFs.<p>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED</p>
							</p>*Problem: Being busy with finals; I'm taking 20 credits and grading 2 classes this semester while working a part-time business job.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Having trouble learning how to post with TikTok (have to use phone and computer for optimal results).</p>
							</p>*Problem: Desperately needing to get more social media content on our WolverineSoft Studio accounts.</p>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*Solution: Prioritize tasks where others depend on me first (including WolverineSoft Studio), then tasks that will benefit me individually.</p>
							</p>*Solution: Researched how to post with TikTok, didn't stop until got a clean looking post up.</p>
							</p>*Solution: Posted on multiple platforms (Linked, Twitter, and TikTok) across multiple days.</p>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Getting up a TikTok post and getting 500+ views and 20+ likes/hearts within 24 hours despite starting off with 0 Followers!</p>
							</p>*Posting on social media accounts throughout the week so each account (except Instagram and TikTok) have a decent amount of content on the profiles.</p>
							</p>*Recording the 20+ 5-second gameplay videos, turning them in by the date I said I would. That was much easier than I thought it would be.</p>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*A lot of my time was attending playtesting sessions (while informative I could've learned a lot about the current state of the games by playing them myself).</p>
							</p>*Several times logging into social media accounts, only to get sidetracked by some other task/class and not end up posting.</p>
							</p>*I still overall don't feel like too much of my time was wasted, especially as much of my work is creating long-term workflows, which means I might not have much immediate progress yet, yet I also think I got immediate progress this semester as well!</p>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Organizing social media schedule at beginning of each Sprint and having someone hold me accountable to stick to it.</p>
							</p>*Creating a similar Airtable (assuming Winter 2022) during Preproduction instead of Alpha 2 Sprint.</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research ideas (now for how to get the most views, impressions, and best algorithms for social medias)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website, overall cleaning up a lot of my work and further summarizing it.</p>
							</p>*Writing up my dev-blog entries DURING the sprints instead of waiting until the end (I do think I was better in Fall 2021 than Winter 2021 at this though).</p>
