								<p>
		
								</p>
									<p>Pre-Gold 1: 9.5 Total Work Hours
										<p>*Apr. 4th - Monday: 0.5 Hours <br>
											I communicated with Spartasoft President and Spartasoft Studio Producer about a connection opportunity. I also saw their Spartasoft page and followed it (gotta keep the rivalry up!).

										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 5th - Tuesday: 1.25 Hours <br>
											From 11:30am - 12:00pm EST I connected Spartasoft President and Spartasoft Studio Producer with Full-Sail University graduate Game Designer who also went to MSU.
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Gold 1 (Apr. 4 - Apr. 10, 2022)/Screenshot (13083).png" alt="" /></span> 
											<br>
											From 7:00pm - 7:45pm EST I attended the Matt Rader playtest session for WolverineSoft Studio.

										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 6th - Wednesday: N/A
										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 7th - Thursday: 3 Hours Total <br>
											From 7:00pm - 9:00pm EST I attended the WolverineSoft general meeting. We were honored to hear Austin Yarger's new XR game-dev course prioritizing Unreal Engine and Perforce with more focus on social impacts than its Unity raw game-dev counterpart course that currently exists. Looks interesting!
											Additionally, we went over historic games in WolverineSoft's history which started in 1999. Some projects I've been involved with/witnessed firsthand were spoken about! It was also super cool to finally see the renowned
											Crisis Wolverine game! Additionally afterwards I attended the WolverineSoft officer meeting.

											<br>
											From 11:00pm - 12:00am EST I networked with some individuals to share the word more about our playtest list and to recruit someone from UC Berkeley for Bluebird Studios.

										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 8th - Friday: N/A
										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 9th - Saturday: 2.25 Hours Total <br>
											From 12:00pm - 2:15pm EST I created our Resume Book Consent form, asking for feedback from the Studio directors and our Advisor Austin Yarger for feedback. I
											told this news to several channels, and created announcement explaining what exactly a Resume Book is. I was careful in how I worded this so as to get form results
											quickly while explaining why we need it in a way so as to encourage people to take it rather than be suspicious of it (like "why would I provide my resume for this?"" type of thing).

										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 10th - Sunday: 2.5 Hours Total <br>
											From 4:00pm - 6:45pm EST I applied marketing and game-design skills I keep learning from WolverineSoft Studio with the Bluebird Studios project. We discussed several designs for the upcoming game, and afterwards I created a brief playtest demographics doc and then reached out to MPowered Entrepreneurship about it.

											If there was any other experiences of personal game-dev growth/WolverineSoft Studio work time this day I did not document it nor do I remember it.

							</p>PRE-GOLD 1 SPRINT RECAP:</p>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR PRE-GOLD 1 SPRINT</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 12 Hours (for 5 Academic Credits 12 Hours Per Week, 12 Hours * 1 Week = 12 Hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint (Week): 9.5 Hours (9.5 Hours from Pre-Gold 1 = 9.5 Hours)</p>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>**Most of my evidence this week is in the form of photos.<p>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED</p>
							</p>*Problem: Being busy with finals; I'm finishing up 23 credits of finals while locking my job positions. As of the end of this week I was still uncertain of my official job prospects/details for Summer 2022.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Creating a Resume Book quickly due to the ask from Activision Blizzard (which is a very valid ask) about joining us as a sponsor; they are very interested, esp. if a Resume Book is involved in a sponsorship deal.</p>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*Solution: Being disciplined, and rememberming repeatedly to CARE about my results and my work to power through it, also lots of prayer.</p>
							</p>*Solution: Had form reviewed by several people in leadership positions, post about it to as many WolverineSoft Studio discords as I'm in to get the word out as quickly as possible to increase chances of more responses in a short time for Resume Book progress.</p>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Creating the Resume Book and getting quick results! It's currently at 9, which for such a short period of time I'm happy to see.</p>
							</p>*Learning the lore of WolverineSoft.</p>
							</p>*Applying skills I've learned in WolverineSoft Studio and testing them out in an external game-dev project environment with Bluebird Studios. Overall it's strongly helping, can't thank my time at WolverineSoft Studio enough for indie game development!</p>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*Asking MPowered Entrepreneurship and another entrepreneurship course to fill out a playtest form; only 1 person filled that out, which was a big yet somewhat expected letdown from those groups.</p>
							</p>*More time could've been spent on raw WolverineSoft Studio social media and research for the game itself as opposed to personal growth opportunities for myself.</p>
							</p>*I still overall don't feel like much of my time was wasted, especially given a 23 credit and Summer 2022 job-finaliziation crunch semester!</p>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Just doing it! (for social media; I've made tons of drafts yet need to start implementing these on a regular basis)</p>
							</p>*Using JIRA for tasks (this is the first week I never used JIRA)</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research ideas (now for how to get the most views, impressions, and best algorithms for social medias)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website, overall cleaning up a lot of my work and further summarizing it.</p>
							</p>*Writing up my dev-blog entries DURING the sprints instead of waiting until the end (I do think I was better in Fall 2021 than Winter 2021 at this though).</p>
