										<p>*Oct. 21st - Thursday: 3 Hours total,
											I attended and was a speaker for the WolverineSoft Mass Meeting from 7pm-9pm ET. The topic I spoke about was "The Philosophy of Entrepreneurship", which took me about an hour to prepare before presenting it at the 7 - 9pm ET meeting.
											Overall I presented a 60-slide presentation covering 10+ basic entrepreneurship concepts from UM's ENTR 500 class, and related it to game development and how these tips are super helpful for any indie game development endeavors.
											The main point I drove home is that if one is going into indie game development then one needs to remember to build the company as well as the product.

								</p>*</p>
							</p>PRE-ALPHA SPRINT 2 RECAP:</p>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS:</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 30 Hours (for 5 Academic Credits 15 Hours Per Week, 15 Hours * 2 Weeks = 30 Hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint: ? Hours (? from Week 1 + 14.75 from Week 2 = ? Hours)</p>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>*Currently I do not have video evidence, yet I have image evidence throughout this website. For next devblog post I plan to procure my best image/video evidence of results for the sprint in this section as well as throughout the website.<p>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:</p>
							</p>*Problem: Due to Scope Limitations, Have to Completely Re-Make Dungeon Objective Designs and Plans</p>
							</p>*Problem: Balancing Midterm Exams with Game Design Time</p>
							</p>*Problem: Time Management (Due to Midterms I Completed Much of My Work Again Towards the End of the Week)</p>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*Last-minute Hustle (Surprisingly Worked Out in Design Favor, as I Was Alerted of Re-Planning of Dungeon Objectives as recently as the evening of 03/06/2021)</p>
							</p>*Combining brainstorming sessions with documentation in real time (Still a great strategy)</p>
							</p>*Incubator-time strategy of doing most/all of week's work in 1-2 days (Week 2)</p>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Dungeon Objective Research (It's Not Complete, Yet Like Where It's Going)</p>
							</p>*Communication between multiple departments (got feedback, listened to, and incorporated ideas from each of the 4 departments)</p>
							</p>*Keeping up with WolverineSoft Studio hours and maintaining overall grades in heavy University of Michigan class courseload (despite Midterm Exams, got great grades on them)</p>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*Documentation of 2nd Dungeon Objective (now in the "Old 2nd Dungeon Objective Iteration" document)</p>
							</p>*Lack of time spent on HTML tutorials (still have much to learn with using HTML)</p>
							</p>*I still overall don't feel like too much of my time was wasted, despite having much of my original Dungeon Objective Designs being incompatible with the state of the game.</p>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Distributing time more evenly throughout the week (Failed this sprint, yet shall try again, midterms is a pretty good excuse to me)</p>
							</p>*Using more time going over tutorials (specifically for HTML, as most of my work is design-focused, thus I don't need to worry as much with Unity at the moment)</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research ideas (Succeeded in this sprint at this objective)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website, continuously updating Blog Post formats, immediate focus on learning how to add/embed videos as well as record videos of game development/progress</p>
							</p>*Still on learning more about Documentation styles, glad to see some of mine being very very successful thus far though in different department creations (such as tower design in art, UI features in programming/art)</p>
						</p>*Spend some of my Sprint time on specifically organizing past website progress.<p> <br> <br>
