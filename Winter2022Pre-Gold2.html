									<p>Pre-Gold 2: ??? Total Work Hours
										<p>*Apr. 11th - Monday: N/A<br>
											I was busy working on my job at Goldcast, a Harvard Business School SaaS startup founded in 2020. Here's a screenshot of what that looks like a bit.
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Gold 2 (Apr. 11 - 17, 2022)/Screenshot (13298).png" alt="" /></span>
										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 12th - Tuesday: 0.5 Hours Total <br>
											From 11:30am - 12:00pm I put out some recruitment posts about Bluebird Studios hiring for the summer. 
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Gold 2 (Apr. 11 - 17, 2022)/Screenshot (13327).png" alt="" /></span>
										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 13th - Wednesday: 0.5 Hours Total <br>
											From around 5:00pm - 5:30pm EST I looked over WolverineSoft Studio channels to keep myself updated on the project. 
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Gold 2 (Apr. 11 - 17, 2022)/Screenshot (13449).png" alt="" /></span>
										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 14th - Thursday: 1.5 Hours Total <br>
											From 7:00pm - 8:30pm ET I attended the WolverineSoft Town Hall. I took a bunch of notes for it on a Notepad text file, with around 200 lines of input from
											club members. Notably I proposed a model for WolverineSoft to adopt to support people who don't make it into the studio since currently the demand for the
											experiential game-dev learning activity is much higher (~75+ applicants each semester) than the supply (~25+ applicants each semester).

										<p>*Apr. 15th - Friday: 15 Hours Total <br>
											Goldcast Stuff

											<br>
											From 11:00am - 12:00pm EST I attended a live Harvard Business School 2+2 Application Office hours. I was shocked that no one in the group was asking questions,
											so I fired away with many I had. I employed tactics I've learned in ELP to give a strong impression of who I am while not appearing as domineering over the others
											in the group, ensuring they had chances to ask their questions/impress the Admissions Officer on the Board a bit.

										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 16th - Saturday: N/A
											From 3:45pm - 6:00pm EST Bluebird Studios met in person at the Dude (Duderstadt building on North Campus at UMich)
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Gold 2 (Apr. 11 - 17, 2022)/Screenshot (13482).png" alt="" /></span>

										</p>
										<p>*Apr. 17th - Sunday: Hours Total <br>
											From 5:00am - 6:30am EST I worked on updates for my devblog site. <br>
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Gold 2 (Apr. 11 - 17, 2022)/Screenshot (13486).png" alt="" /></span>

											From 10:00am - 10:30am EST I continued updating my dev-blog entry for the Pre-Gold 1 Sprint.

											<br>
											From 10:30am - 12:30pm EST I attended my church via Livestream. I would've gone in person, yet I needed to finish my time with WolverineSoft Studio so doing this saved me work-time. 
											I haven't tried this before with the church I'm currently attending, it worked well! I was blessed to hear a sermon about Jesus Christ's death, burial, and resurrection from the dead from a new angle.
											To be clear I'm not counting this time as work-time.

											From 12:30pm - 3:00pm EST I just completed a bunch of miscellaneous marketing and studio tasks, primarily updating the social medias on the itch pages we had,
											with providing thought-out feedback for the Studio W'22 Post Mortem form, and learning more about itch.io.

											<br>
											From 4:00pm - 11:00pm EST I completed a bunch of marketing work (with a 1 hour break from Studio work, which I used to gain philosophy advice from a professor for an upcoming exam and eat dinner), including but not limited to:

								</p>*</p>
							</p>PRE-GOLD 2 SPRINT RECAP:</p>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR PRE-GOLD 2 - GOLD RELEASE SPRINT: 24.5</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 15 Hours (for 5 Academic Credits 15 Hours Per Week, 15 Hours * 1 Week = 15 Hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint (Week): 24.5 (17.5 from Pre-Gold + 7 from Gold Release = 24.5 Hours)</p>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>*Most of my evidence this week is in the form of photos or GIFs.<p>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED</p>
							</p>*Problem: Being busy with finals; I'm taking 20 credits and grading 2 classes this semester while working a part-time business job.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Finding a way to capture and observe itch.io rankings for our games the 48 hours after their releases.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Trying not to spam people too much the day during our game releases with social media and Discord announcements.</p>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*Solution: Prioritize tasks where others depend on me first (including WolverineSoft Studio), then tasks that will benefit me individually.</p>
							</p>*Solution: Capturing GIFs and photos like crazy after the 32 hour mark, then watching various game search categories on itch.io.</p>
							</p>*Solution: Space out posts throughout day, and use different social media platforms to not be annoying in one chat space for too long.</p>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Gathering itch.io rankings and organizing them on the WolverineSoft Studio Fall 2021 Airtable Workspace.</p>
							</p>*Gathering social media data and organizing it on the WolverineSoft Studio Fall 2021 Airtable Workspace.</p>
							</p>*Creating GIFs for the Ragnarok TD page. We got some pretty unique ones up there (my favorite--the one-life one! close second the 5-second wave one).</p>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*Trying to create more TikTok videos back-to-back-to-back. (Too many posts at once for that one)</p>
							</p>*Lack of time spent on HTML tutorials (still have much to learn with using HTML)</p>
							</p>*I still overall don't feel like too much of my time was wasted, especially as much of my work is creating long-term workflows, which means I might not have much immediate progress yet, yet I also think I got immediate progress this semester as well!</p>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Organizing social media schedule at beginning of each Sprint and having someone hold me accountable to stick to it.</p>
							</p>*Creating a similar Airtable (assuming Winter 2022) during Preproduction instead of Alpha 2 Sprint.</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research ideas (now for how to get the most views, impressions, and best algorithms for social medias)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website, overall cleaning up a lot of my work and further summarizing it.</p>
							</p>*Writing up my dev-blog entries DURING the sprints instead of waiting until the end (I do think I was better in Fall 2021 than Winter 2021 at this though).</p>
