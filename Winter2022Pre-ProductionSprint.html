									physical Ann Arbor branch location from around 11pm - 8am EST. Main work I got done was the Ultimate Design Doc for our game early in the morning
									so the team could have a cohesive vision and know what tasks to generally accomplish over the Game Jam. I managed our team based upon group progress
									between art, audio, and programming.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>*Jan. 30th - Sunday: Day 3 of the Global Game Jam 2022. I mainly completed Level Design and oversaw a successful submission of our project, which
