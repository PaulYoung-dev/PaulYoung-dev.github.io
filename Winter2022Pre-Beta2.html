											<br>
											From 8:00pm - 10:00pm EST I attended the WolverineSoft Community Event. I am not counting this towards my studio hours, as this was just a casual gaming hangout. Well-needed rest, this was pretty fun!

										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Beta 2 (Mar. 21, 2022 - Apr. 3, 2022)/Screenshot (12838).png" alt="" /></span>

										<br>
										From 2:30pm - 3:00pm I created a brief playtest form for Bluebird Studios.
										<br>

									<p>*Apr. 1st - Friday: N/A</p>
									<p>*Apr. 2nd - Saturday: 4.75 Hours Total <br>
										From 1:00pm - 1:30pm EST I thought up and shared marketing advise directly with Spartasoft Studio Producer Gaby.
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Beta 2 (Mar. 21, 2022 - Apr. 3, 2022)/Screenshot (12839).png" alt="" /></span>
										<br>
										From 2:30pm - 4:00pm I learned how to use Figma (a prototyping/design tool) and shared word about the Playtest List for Bluebird Studios.
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Beta 2 (Mar. 21, 2022 - Apr. 3, 2022)/Screenshot (12839).png" alt="" /></span>
										<br>
										From 4:00pm - 4:45pm EST I had a Discord conversation with the President of Spartasoft and Assistant Producer of Spartasoft Studio David. I asked to market the Playtest form, which quickly turned into a somewhat intense conversation about the future of Spartasoft Studio and what my thoughts were for their future plans. I agreed with much of it and think they're going in a good direction overall.
										<br>
										I don't have photo evidence as I would rather not share what we discussed; regardless, I gave well-thought marketing and internal workflow advice for Spartasoft Studio with the President of Spartasoft who I get along with great.
										<br>
										From 5:15pm - 6:00pm EST I used Figma to create basic designs for a home screen for Bluebird Studios, which I later presented.
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Beta 2 (Mar. 21, 2022 - Apr. 3, 2022)/Screenshot (12839).png" alt="" /></span>
										<br>
										From 6:15pm - 7:00pm EST I attended the Bluebird Studios debrief meeting, where I presented my design ideas, saw my meeting suggestion enacted (using a PowerPoint to keep meeting time more in check during meetings), and made several advising suggestions for Phase 2 of the app game.
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Beta 2 (Mar. 21, 2022 - Apr. 3, 2022)/Screenshot (12839).png" alt="" /></span>
										<br>
										From 7:30pm - 8:00pm EST I talked with some people to raise the amount of playtesters we have on our playtest list for Bluebird Studios and I reached out to someone to help work on the project as we're looking for a 2-D Animator.
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Beta 2 (Mar. 21, 2022 - Apr. 3, 2022)/Screenshot (12839).png" alt="" /></span>
									</p>
									<p>*Apr. 3rd - Sunday: ??? Hours Total<br>
										From 1:00am - 1:30am EST I organized some of my weekly screenshots and files of time I've completed during this Sprint.

										From 11:00am - 12:??pm EST I attended the WolverineSoft Studio meeting.

								</p>
								</p>*</p>
							</p>PRE-BETA 2 RECAP:</p> *still need to complete this section*
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS:</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 24 Hours (for 4 Academic Credits 12 Hours Per Week, 12 Hours * 2 Weeks = 24 Hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint: ??? Hours (??? from Week 1 + ??? from Week 2 = ??? Hours)</p>
							</p>*I celebrated Thanksgiving with my family and used much of the break to catch up on homework for other classes,
								so this sprint I focused less on pushing social media posts and more time on long-term value material for WolverineSoft Studio (such as
								the 30+ video clips of gameplay that can be used for game trailers or social media content, the Sponsorship strategy doc, etc.). 
								For the Pre-Gold sprints I plan to focus much more heavily on the social media post side.</p>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>Since I worked on gameplay videos I have video evidence! Also images per the usual dev blog entry of course.<p>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:</p>
							</p>*Problem: Navigating the nuances of WolverineSoft Studio authority when it comes to externally representing our brand.</p>
							</p>*Problem: ShareX video recording settings not working OR not working at a high enough quality to my liking.</p>
							</p>*Problem: My computer can't handle recording at a high-ish quality the games Caduceus and Rideshare Rampage without lag.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Being behind in classes (taking 20 credits and doing 2 part time jobs to stay financially afloat) and not marketing externally much due to
								Thanksgiving Break, also for less work time with celebrating Thanksgiving with my family.</p>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*I had a direct meeting with Amber, George, and Brandon to ensure I'm not stepping out of bounds with my marketing/networking strategies.</p>
							</p>*I looked up lots of videos, and eventually realized I can't have other softwares that use the mic open for optimal ShareX conditions.</p>
							</p>*I decided to use my time on other tasks as I think up a solution for recording these more advanced games.</p>
							</p>*I just did a lot of homework, drank a lot of hot tea, listened to lots of complex music, and just willed my way to work hard.
								A really motivating thing when in these tough times is remembering that these short and momentary troubles are far outweighed by
								the long-term. It's only 2-3 more weeks of grind!</p>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Establishing starting actionable steps for sponsorship strategy.</p>
							</p>*Recordings of video gameplay clips.</p>
							</p>*Inviting lots of people on LinkedIn to our game showcasing on December 10th.</p>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*Organizing dev-blog website as a whole. While much better than it looked last Sprint still has so much more to go to make my work marketable.</p>
							</p>*Organizing game files. I spent lots of time re-organizing how to access those on my site and over-complicating the process.</p>
							</p>*This week I strongly felt that my time was used wisely. I learned a lot about how to record video gameplay (now a career as a Twitch YouTuber is an open class in the RPG of my life lol).</p>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Distributing time more evenly throughout the week (I'm getting better at this I've noticed.)</p>
							</p>*Using less time on organizing my dev-blog website (I can do that during Christmas/Winter break I suppose)</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research marketing strategies/principles (Succeeded in this Sprint yet should do even more)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website (this is still needed, yet I need to spend less time on this but still make it a priority)</p>
							</p>*Still on learning more about Documentation styles, glad to see my work get featured again in this Sprint, definitely a confidence booster</p>
							</p>*Spend LOTS of my sprint time on action! (Marketing posts/networking attempts/strategizing/etc., AKA finishing this semester with a bang!)<p> <br> <br>
