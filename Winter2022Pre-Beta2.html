											<br>
											From 8:00pm - 10:00pm EST I attended the WolverineSoft Community Event. I am not counting this towards my studio hours, as this was just a casual gaming hangout. Well-needed rest, this was pretty fun!

								<p>Week 2: ??? Total Work Hours
									<p>*Mar. 28th - Monday: 2 Hours Total<br>
										From 10:00pm - 12:00am EST I created a Contact List for WolverineSoft (using a prior list I have made for MPowered Entrepreneurship), and I updated the Art contacts section.
										I only took a screenshot of the work after the fact, yet for evidence I made comments in the Officer channel as I was building the list out and I'd be more than happy to show
										the version history of the file, which shows the changes I made between 6:53pm EST and around midnight the next day: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pWHnqQZyL6Ep2Gv-rMBed8wMxke3aHHM4p2tDVkzPBI/edit#gid=0
										As can be seen, I changed around 200+ contacts' email infos by retrieving that from MaizePages via a quick search strategy I created.
										<br>

									<p>*Mar. 29th - Tuesday: N/A</p>
									<p>*Mar. 30th - Wednesday: N/A</p>
									<p>*Mar. 31st - Thursday: 2 Hours Total<br>
										From 7:00pm - 9:00pm EST Bluebird Studios met in-person at BBB 1690 on North Campus since WolverineSoft didn't host an in-person event this week.
										Here we discussed several level design and startup workflows for Bluebird Studios and went over our current Jira tasks. Overall
										I'm helping with this endeavor by applying stuff I've learned from WolverineSoft Studio and UM's Entrepreneurs Leadership Program to catalyze the game development and startup process.
										<br>
										Chris Okumura is the founder of this high-quality endeavor and my fellow Fellow in ELP! My role specifically is as a strategist and level designer.
									</p>
									<p>*Apr. 1st - Friday: 1.5 Hours Total <br> 
										From 10:30pm - 12:00am EST I researched and completed some audio and design work at the Shammy Jam.
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Beta 2 (Mar. 21, 2022 - Apr. 3, 2022)/Screenshot (11955).png" alt="" /></span>
										<br> 
									</p>
									<p>*Apr. 2nd - Saturday: 9 Hours Total <br>
										From 12:00am - 12:30am EST I spent some time learning more about Warmilu, an entreprenuerial startup that makes non-electric warming blankets for infants to save physical lives around the world. 
										<br>
										I got offered a part-time internship job from my Entrepreneurs Leadership Program professor Grace Hsia on early Friday evening for a Strategic Business Development and Operations Internship after I applied!
										<br>
										This is a phenomenal entrepreneurial learning opportunity for me to gain raw business development experience while directly working with arguably one of the best--a Forbes 30 under 30 person and the individual that teaches the university's most elite entrepreneurship course--in the entrepreneurial field at the University of Michigan for a part of life I'm curious to learn more about as a philosopher (that being the world of health startups whose purposes are to save physical lives; as a philosopher I usually focus on less tangible work that nonetheless I believe helps others ultimately in life-changing ways).
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Beta 2 (Mar. 21, 2022 - Apr. 3, 2022)/Screenshot (11955).png" alt="" /></span>
										<br>
										From 1:00pm - 3:00pm EST I spent some time learning more about Warmilu and raw business development tactics (while a completely different industry than software/gamification, which is the career direction I'm leaning towards, because of that I can learn and apply supremely unique patterns that few would analyze between these cross industries).
										<br>

										I also spent a little time at the Game Jam trying out some audio stuff (unfortunately I forgot my MIDI keyboard this day, so I had to rely on the good 'ole QWERTY keyboard for my Studio One 5 Pro DAW). However, most of my time was spent on looking at the Warmilu stuff in this section of my dev-blog, yet which I believe is super valuable for my multidisciplinary perspective as a marketer and developer of entrepreneurial ideas and organizations.

										<br>
										Some of the stuff I learned from Grace's resources were also links to articles, one of which was a cool article about prototyping; I've been meaning to do more research on these marketing/entrepreneurial/database-searching topics as an aspiring entrepreneur, so I finally spent some time on the research side a bit also!
										<br>
										<br>
										From 5:00pm - 7:00pm EST I tried figuring out how to implement "play sound" types of codes in C++ for our game jam project. Since I've been exclusively focusing on marketing tactics for WolverineSoft Studio, I also want to make sure I'm staying up-to-date with my basic game design/art/audio/programming knowledge.
										<br>
										However, alas, I still couldn't figure it out, even though I did learn more about how to operate in Visual Studio again (I'm used to Visual Studio Code, so was a bit unfamiliar/unused to it at first).
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Beta 2 (Mar. 21, 2022 - Apr. 3, 2022)/Screenshot (11955).png" alt="" /></span>

										In this time I also made really small tweaks and updates to Marketing stuff for WolverineSoft Studio, such as double-checking email template I'm using soon to reach out to companies, organizing social pic content for future marketing of WolverineSoft and WolverineSoft Studio, etc.
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Beta 2 (Mar. 21, 2022 - Apr. 3, 2022)/Screenshot (11955).png" alt="" /></span>

										<br>
										From 7:00pm - 11:30pm EST I attended the WolverineSoft Studio in-person workshop and had a blast meeting the team!! There I was able to get quick approvals from Devon and Nikhil, which helped me change the WolverineSoft Studio itch.io page quickly and to try several design ideas.

										<br>
										I also researched about Jira stuff in general (also likely bugged WolverineSoft Studio Project Lead Nikhil out like crazy asking about programming terminology in person lol), updated my Jira with new marketing tasks, set up my MailMerge for the email outreach (now planned to happen on Tuesday, March 22nd), and seriously started to request student work to post with based upon responses I got from my previously sent-out marketing consent form.

									<p>*Apr. 3rd - Sunday: 8.25 Hours Total<br>
										From 1:00am - 1:30am EST I learned some audio design principles from Faraaz on a previous music file I had created and his feedback for it.
										Additionally from 2:00am - 3:00am I tinkered around with MIDI and audio settings in Studio One 5.

										<br>
										From 6:30am - 7:00am EST I formulated/organized social media content to prepare for big marketing pushes as Project Rage nears development (posts were about old WolverineSoft games--have one ready for all of them except Dreamwillow).

										<br>
										At 9:30am I took a timestamp showing I made it! I pulled the all-nighter solo to host the WolverineSoft Game Jam (Shammy Jam 2022) event in BBB 1690 on North Campus at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor!

								</p>*</p>
							</p>PRE-BETA 2 RECAP:</p>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS:</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 24 Hours (for 4 Academic Credits 12 Hours Per Week, 12 Hours * 2 Weeks = 24 Hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint: ??? Hours (??? from Week 1 + ??? from Week 2 = ??? Hours)</p>
							</p>*I celebrated Thanksgiving with my family and used much of the break to catch up on homework for other classes,
								so this sprint I focused less on pushing social media posts and more time on long-term value material for WolverineSoft Studio (such as
								the 30+ video clips of gameplay that can be used for game trailers or social media content, the Sponsorship strategy doc, etc.). 
								For the Pre-Gold sprints I plan to focus much more heavily on the social media post side.</p>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>Since I worked on gameplay videos I have video evidence! Also images per the usual dev blog entry of course.<p>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:</p>
							</p>*Problem: Navigating the nuances of WolverineSoft Studio authority when it comes to externally representing our brand.</p>
							</p>*Problem: ShareX video recording settings not working OR not working at a high enough quality to my liking.</p>
							</p>*Problem: My computer can't handle recording at a high-ish quality the games Caduceus and Rideshare Rampage without lag.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Being behind in classes (taking 20 credits and doing 2 part time jobs to stay financially afloat) and not marketing externally much due to
								Thanksgiving Break, also for less work time with celebrating Thanksgiving with my family.</p>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*I had a direct meeting with Amber, George, and Brandon to ensure I'm not stepping out of bounds with my marketing/networking strategies.</p>
							</p>*I looked up lots of videos, and eventually realized I can't have other softwares that use the mic open for optimal ShareX conditions.</p>
							</p>*I decided to use my time on other tasks as I think up a solution for recording these more advanced games.</p>
							</p>*I just did a lot of homework, drank a lot of hot tea, listened to lots of complex music, and just willed my way to work hard.
								A really motivating thing when in these tough times is remembering that these short and momentary troubles are far outweighed by
								the long-term. It's only 2-3 more weeks of grind!</p>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Establishing starting actionable steps for sponsorship strategy.</p>
							</p>*Recordings of video gameplay clips.</p>
							</p>*Inviting lots of people on LinkedIn to our game showcasing on December 10th.</p>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*Organizing dev-blog website as a whole. While much better than it looked last Sprint still has so much more to go to make my work marketable.</p>
							</p>*Organizing game files. I spent lots of time re-organizing how to access those on my site and over-complicating the process.</p>
							</p>*This week I strongly felt that my time was used wisely. I learned a lot about how to record video gameplay (now a career as a Twitch YouTuber is an open class in the RPG of my life lol).</p>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Distributing time more evenly throughout the week (I'm getting better at this I've noticed.)</p>
							</p>*Using less time on organizing my dev-blog website (I can do that during Christmas/Winter break I suppose)</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research marketing strategies/principles (Succeeded in this Sprint yet should do even more)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website (this is still needed, yet I need to spend less time on this but still make it a priority)</p>
							</p>*Still on learning more about Documentation styles, glad to see my work get featured again in this Sprint, definitely a confidence booster</p>
							</p>*Spend LOTS of my sprint time on action! (Marketing posts/networking attempts/strategizing/etc., AKA finishing this semester with a bang!)<p> <br> <br>
