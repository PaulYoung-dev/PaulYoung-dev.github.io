								</p>
							</p>
						</p>*</p>
						</p>Pre-Alpha Sprint 1 Recap:</p>
							</p>Total Number of Hours for the Past 2 Weeks:</p>
								</p>*Target Number of Hours: 18 Hours (for 3 Academic Credits 9 Hours Per Week, 9 Hours * 2 Weeks = 18 Hours)</p>
								</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint: 22.5 Hours (9 from Week 1 + 14.5 from Week 2 = 23.5 Hours)</p>
							</p>Image and Video Evidence (in the Form of Links Because I'm Still Learning how to program in HTML, plan to update this soon):</p>
								</p>*Dungeon Objectives Documentation: https://studio.eecs.umich.edu/confluence/display/PWW2/Dungeon+Objectives</p>
								</p>*Enemy Design Philosophy Documentation: https://studio.eecs.umich.edu/confluence/display/PWW2/Enemy+Design+Philosophy</p>
								</p>*Enemy Design Reference Documentation: https://studio.eecs.umich.edu/confluence/display/PWW2/Enemy+Design+Reference</p>
								</p>*Google Document with Image and Video Evidence: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H8zUXh4uXvzT9pefMQkfMqmVCCzorngUQfJ99CwOtNE/edit?usp=sharing</p>
							</p>Bugs and Problems Encountered:</p>
								</p>*Slow movement in Unity (due to lack of having a Mouse, laptop Mousepad is not ideal)</p>
								</p>*Speed of 1st Dungeon Objective Greyboxxing (again due to lacking a Computer Mouse for my laptop)</p>
								</p>*Balancing project hours in Week 2 (I completed all of them in the final 2 days)</p>
							</p>Time Management Strategies Used:</p>
								</p>*Organized-time strategy of even distribution throughout the week (Week 1)</p>
								</p>*Combining brainstorming sessions with documentation in real time</p>
								</p>*Incubator-time strategy of doing most/all of week's work in 1-2 days (Week 2)</p>
							</p>Successful Tasks:</p>
								</p>*Dungeon Objective Documentation (Artist Natalie Neumann almost perfectly drew what I envisioned in my head, seeing those drawings were amazing)</p>
								</p>*Communication between multiple departments (got feedback, listened to, and incorporated ideas from each of the 4 departments)</p>
								</p>*Keeping up with WolverineSoft Studio hours and maintaining overall grades in heavy University of Michigan class courseload (total is 18 credits this semester)</p>
							</p>Unsuccessful Time Investments:</p>
								</p>*Using some of my greyboxxing time trying to get a working player in it (we already had player drafts in the main "cloudinterior" project files)</p>
								</p>*Lack of tutorial organization (should be watching these in order, this didn't hurt in the short-term but probably will in the long-term if I continue watching tutorials without viewing them in a planned order)</p>
								</p>*I overall don't feel like too much of my time was wasted.</p>
							</p>Strategies for Improving in Future Sprints:</p>
								</p>*Distributing time more evenly throughout the week</p>
								</p>*Using more time going over tutorials</p>
								</p>*Using more time to research ideas</p>
								</p>*Continuing to format this website, continuously updating Blog Post formats, immediate focus on learning how to add/embed images</p>
								</p>*Learning more about Documentation styles, incorporate more images and take out rough draft notes eventually</p>
