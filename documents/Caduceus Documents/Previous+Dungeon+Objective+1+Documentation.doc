    <h1>Previous Dungeon Objective 1 Documentation</h1>
    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <p>The 1st Dungeon Objective is a test of the player's platforming =
skills, which is ultimately a platforming challenge where the player gets f=
rom Point A to Point B. For whatever reason the player must take a risky li=
near route, going over a chasm by hopping from one floating platform to ano=
ther floating platform. Point A (where the player enters) is lower than Poi=
nt B (the other side of the chasm), so the overall slope is slightly angled=
 upwards. The platforms themselves are at first large in size and easy to j=
ump to; however, as the player gets closer to the other side the platforms =
are now each moving in a 2D way (i.e. either up &amp; down or left &amp; ri=
ght), the platforms get smaller and smaller in size, and the platforms are =
further apart (making timing of jumps that much more important).&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id=3D"PreviousDungeonObjective1Documentation-RouteDesign">Route Design<=
/h1>
<p><u><strong>Direction</strong></u></p>
<p>The player moves forward, ultimately going from Point A to Point B. The =
platforms are floating, and the player goes forward to the end of the room.=
 There is <u>no going backwards</u>, as a platform will disappear as soon a=
s a player leaps off of it.</p>
<p><u><strong>Slope</strong></u></p>
<p>Since Point A is lower than Point B, the slope will be slightly angled u=
pwards. The player moves forward while going at an upwards trajectory. This=
 shouldn't be too steep.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Enemies (or Enemy)</strong></u></p>
<p>There should be one Minotaur or one Satyr on Point B, as that will make =
the ending even slightly more difficult and overall satisfying (which would=
 be good). <em>If this happens that one Minotaur/Satyr could end up being t=
he project meme.</em></p>
<h1 id=3D"PreviousDungeonObjective1Documentation-PlatformDesign">Platform D=
esign</h1>
<p><u><strong>Shape</strong></u></p>
<p>The shapes used at the beginning are flat squares, yet as the player is =
almost at Point B, the shapes become different/obscure. If possible impleme=
nting unique and distorted shapes would be effective; if not possible then =
adding in basic circles/polygons would work.</p>
<p><u><strong>Size</strong></u></p>
<p>For about the first half of the Dungeon Objective the platforms are the =
same size and are small (player can't walk very freely on them) yet are eas=
y to land on and jump off of. At about the <u>halfway point they start to g=
et smaller in size</u>.</p>
<p><u><strong>Characteristics</strong></u></p>
<p>The platforms are solid, yet once the player leaps off of a platform <u>=
it shall disappear</u>. Also the <u><em>final platform</em></u>&nbsp;has a =
unique trait; when the player lands on it, it will shoot down very fast, th=
en slowly go back up again. This is a jolt to the player and <em><strong>is=
 cause for a memorable experience</strong>.</em></p>
<p><u><strong>Movement</strong></u></p>
<p>The first 1/3 of the Dungeon Objective only has stationary platforms (i.=
e. they don't move). At about the 1/3 distance marker some platforms now mo=
ve left and right for the rest of the Dungeon Objective. At about the 2/3 d=
istance marker some platforms now move up and down.</p>
<p><u><strong>Number</strong></u></p>
<p>For now I'm thinking of about 30-50+ platforms. However, due to playtest=
ing scope this number can get reduced, would <u>aim to have a 20 platform m=
inimum</u> (10's a bit low to convey differences in Dungeon Objective layou=
t, 20 think would be good enough to have a noticeable difficulty shift as t=
he player progresses through the Dungeon Objective).</p>
<h1 id=3D"PreviousDungeonObjective1Documentation-DungeonObjectiveDesign">Du=
ngeon Objective Design</h1>
<p><u><strong>What Points A and B Are</strong></u></p>
<p>Point A is the entrance floor where the player starts. The player comes =
from a Greek-looking door, and cannot return back to the 1st Dungeon. Point=
 B is a floor on the other side of the chasm that is somewhat higher up tha=
n Point A. On Point A there is a lever that can only be activated with the =
Zeus puzzle pieces gained from the dungeon; the player must activate it to =
<u>make the platforms appear</u>. On Point B there is a lever that also can=
 only be activated through using the Zeus puzzle pieces gained from the dun=
geon; this opens a wide Greek-looking door at the end of it, which when the=
 player walks through either pops up a load screen or shows the 2nd Dungeon=
.</p>
<p><u><strong>How the Player Should Feel</strong></u></p>
<p>The player should feel like a boss. Also no matter how much power the pl=
ayer gained throughout the 1st Dungeon this platforming challenge should st=
ill feel challenging to the player. The player should feel like accomplishi=
ng this challenge is a run for his/her money. At the end of it the player s=
hould still feel a bit cocky and confident. To encourage this ambience the =
music should combine elements of the song examples from the&nbsp;<a href=3D=
"/confluence/display/PWW2/Revamped+1st+Dungeon+Objective+Design">Revamped 1=
st Dungeon Objective Design</a>&nbsp;document.</p>
<p><u><strong>Design Features Description</strong></u></p>
<p>The player first activates the lever at Point A using the Zeus puzzle pi=
eces collected from the 1st Dungeon, which <u>makes the platforms in the ch=
asm appear</u>. The player must move forward hopping from one floating plat=
form to another, platforms which are set at an angle since Point&nbsp;B=E2=
=80=93where the player needs to get&nbsp;to=E2=80=93is slightly higher up t=
han Point A. At about the <u>1/3 distance marker</u> some platforms now mov=
e left and right for the rest of the Dungeon Objective. At about the <u>hal=
fway point</u> the platforms start to get smaller and are more irregular sh=
apes than simple squares. At about the <u>2/3 distance marker</u> some plat=
forms now also move up and down. The final platform is front and center and=
 is super close to Point B, a futuristic-looking floor. When the player <u>=
lands on the final platform it falls downwards rapidly</u>, going even lowe=
r than Point A's elevation for a scare to the player; after that <u>it will=
 slowly rise back to where it was</u>, and if the player is still on it the=
n the player can safely hop onto Point B. Using pieces obtained from the 1s=
t Dungeon the player activates the lever/node in the middle of Point B, and=
 a big Greek-looking door opens. The player goes through it, and either a l=
oad screen pops up or the 2nd Dungeon can be seen.</p>
