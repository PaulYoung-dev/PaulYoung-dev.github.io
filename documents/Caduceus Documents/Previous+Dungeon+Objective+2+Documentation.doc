<p><u><strong>Design Features Description</strong></u></p>
<p>The player spawns in an ancient Greek pavilion, having entered from an a=
ncient Greek-looking door. The player cannot go back to the 2nd Dungeon. Th=
ere is an eery atmosphere, either no music or a quiet mysterious sound play=
s. The player moves forward, exiting the pavilion and enters the Combat Are=
na, which is connected to the pavilion. As soon as the player steps foot in=
 the arena a tough combat music plays, and there are either 25 or 50 enemie=
s in the arena, probably all 3 types of enemies. About 60% of the enemies a=
re Minotaurs, 30% of the enemies are Satyrs, and 10% of the enemies are Pho=
enices. After killing the 25 or 50 enemies the music turns silent and there=
 is a 10-30 second wait. After 10-15 seconds a text dialogue appears of Her=
mes' thought, wondering what to do next. Then the music plays again and the=
 other 25 or 50 enemies all spawn at about the same time, entering through =
1-3 hidden doors in the arena wall. After the player downs these 25 or 50 e=
nemies the music changes to a quick few second grand intro for an item=E2=
=80=93the Zeus MasterBolt--that appears in the middle of the arena. Once th=
e player takes the item, the player can go through one of the doors that th=
e enemies came from. Once the player enters through that door either a load=
 screen pops up or the Final Dungeon Objective begins.</p>
