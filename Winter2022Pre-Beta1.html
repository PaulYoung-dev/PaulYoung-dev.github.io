											From 7:00pm - 9:15pm EST I attended the IGDA Ann Arbor "Studio Sustainability / Entrepreneurship Panel" event. <br>

											Unfortunately I missed the "Beyond Inheritance: The Composition Design Pattern" Talk by WolverineSoft Studio Advisor Austin Yarger earlier that day.
											<br>
											From 4:00pm to 5:00pm EST I created my tasks in Jira with descriptions, and decided what I needed to focus on for this Sprint, especially since it was getting towards the end of this week.

											From 8:00pm to 10:00pm EST I revitalized the social media schedule I had created for this schedule, updating it and creating social media pre-content. <br>
											I also created gameplay footage of Bloom: Roots of Renewal to be used as visual content for WolverineSoft Studio, since I had not recorded gameplay for that last semester since the game was still in progress.

								<p>Week 2: ??? Total Work Hours
									<p>*Mar. 14th - Monday: Bonus - Goldcast Annual Kickoff 2022!
										At the Harvard Business School SaaS startup I'm currently working at part-time I was honored to be in charge of creating the event for the company's kickoff.
										Here's a rough draft peek of what it looked like! (Final version was way different as we just updated our branding)

									<p>*Mar. 18th - Friday: ??? Hours Total <br> 
										From 6:30pm - 8:00pm EST I attended a Bluebird Studios dev-team meeting. I was recently onboarded to be an Adivsor & Strategist for Bluebird Studios, which was created by my friend from the U-M Entrepreneurs Leadership Program Chris Okumura.
										At this meeting we played a team-building game, did game design work for the current game "Treat Team", and I introduced the team to Jira.
										For this time I did not take screenshots.
									</p>
									<p>*Mar. 19th - Saturday: ??? Hours Total <br>
										From 8:30pm - 10:00pm EST I figured out how to set up Jira in a way to accomodate for all Treat Team progress and gave strategic advise to its founder based upon my WolverineSoft Studio and entrepreneurial experiences.

										From 11:00am - 11:30am EST I attended the general WolverineSoft Studio meeting virtually.

								</p>
							</p>*</p>
						</p>PRE-BETA 1 RECAP:</p>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS: ???</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 24 Hours (for 4 Academic Credits 12 Hours Per Week, 12 Hours * 2 Weeks = 24 Hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint: ??? Hours (??? from Week 1 + ??? from Week 2 = ??? Hours)</p>
							</p>*I only attained hours this high due to working on 2 game jams also. I wanted to do these since I want to make my portfolio stronger since I'm still fairly new to game-dev/computer science and to learn how to make games/work with new people rapidly.
								 While I am behind on my marketing goals I have been keeping up with Narrative and now have gained the game dev experience I've wanted.
								 The next sprint is going to be much more marketing-focused, yet for my personal growth as a game-dev I think I made the right decisions as to what to do these past 2 weekends,
								 as these game jam experiences will be great memories for me probably for life--even if the next week is rough catching up with classes, still, totally worth it.</p>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>*I do not have video evidence yet, but do have image, link, games, and file evidence to support my work endeavors on this page and this page: 
							<a href="genericMenu.html">Games I've Worked On</a><p>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:</p>
							</p>*Problem: Narrative finding it's footing in Project Tower</p>
							</p>*Problem: Balancing other University of Michigan Extracurriculars with Game Design Time</p>
							</p>*Problem: Over-commitment (I did 2 game jams in 2 weekends in a row--with my busy schedule it's been pretty tough, but I am building my portfolio up))</p>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*Making sure I took on tasks and work that I enjoyed so I could power through such a busy schedule</p>
							</p>*Accepting more help from teammates in WolverineSoft Studio and my game jams than I normally would,
								including taking on a more limited role for the 2nd game jam by focusing only on audio.</p>
							</p>*Getting sleep instead of pulling all-nighters so while my work times were shorter they were more efficient generally. Still feel sleep-deprived though lol
								but since I feel like I'm getting my personal goals done it's totally worth it.</p>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Ameliorating my devblog website so it is on track for being marketable (it looks MUCH better)!</p>
							</p>*Making sure I get game dev experience along with my marketing experience through persevering through 2 game jams in 2 consecutive weekends amidst a rigorous curriculum.</p>
							</p>*Overall maintaining University of Michigan grades and getting a lot done with WolverineSoft Studio despite some big time commitments with other extracurriculars and homework.</p>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*Many of my marketing plans and lacking to post as much content as I wanted to these past two weeks</p>
							</p>*Lack of time spent on HTML tutorials (still have much to learn with using HTML)</p>
							</p>*I still overall don't feel like too much of my time was wasted; while I'm behind on my marketing goals I am pretty much all set with learning game dev skills that I wanted to for this semester through the 3 game jams I've completed (strengthening game design on different types of game projects such as the Pumpkin Game Jam for a 3D game with Nikhil, trying a hand on mainly doing art, leading a team of smarter students than myself with the Berkeley jam, and trying just audio at the Turkey Jam), so now I can focus almost exclusively on marketing itself.</p>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Distributing time more evenly throughout the week while putting in more time per time spent on Game Design</p>
							</p>*Using more time going over tutorials (specifically for HTML, as most of my work is design-focused, thus I don't need to worry as much with Unity at the moment)</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research ideas (I should've done more research in this sprint)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website, continuously updating Blog Post formats, especially on recording videos of game development/progress</p>
							</p>*Still on learning more about Documentation styles, glad to see some of my work continuing to be featured for the Design Department</p>
							</p>*Spend MOST of my Sprint time the next two weeks on marketing, communication, and content.<p> <br> <br>
