							</p>*</p>
						</p>PRE-BETA 1 RECAP:</p>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS: ???</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 24 Hours (for 4 Academic Credits 12 Hours Per Week, 12 Hours * 2 Weeks = 24 Hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint: ??? Hours (??? from Week 1 + ??? from Week 2 = ??? Hours)</p>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>*I do not have video evidence yet, but do have image, link, games, and file evidence to support my work endeavors on this page and this page: 
							<a href="genericMenu.html">Games I've Worked On</a><p>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:</p>
							</p>*Problem: Procrastination of implementing marketing tasks.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Balancing other University of Michigan Extracurriculars with Game Design Time</p>
							</p>*Problem: Over-commitment (I did 2 game jams in 2 weekends in a row--with my busy schedule it's been pretty tough, but I am building my portfolio up))</p>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*Making sure I took on tasks and work that I enjoyed so I could power through such a busy schedule</p>
							</p>*Accepting more help from teammates in WolverineSoft Studio and my game jams than I normally would,
								including taking on a more limited role for the 2nd game jam by focusing only on audio.</p>
							</p>*Getting sleep instead of pulling all-nighters so while my work times were shorter they were more efficient generally. Still feel sleep-deprived though lol
								but since I feel like I'm getting my personal goals done it's totally worth it.</p>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Ameliorating my devblog website so it is on track for being marketable (it looks MUCH better)!</p>
							</p>*Making sure I get game dev experience along with my marketing experience through persevering through 2 game jams in 2 consecutive weekends amidst a rigorous curriculum.</p>
							</p>*Overall maintaining University of Michigan grades and getting a lot done with WolverineSoft Studio despite some big time commitments with other extracurriculars and homework.</p>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*Many of my marketing plans and lacking to post as much content as I wanted to these past two weeks</p>
							</p>*Lack of time spent on HTML tutorials (still have much to learn with using HTML)</p>
							</p>*I still overall don't feel like too much of my time was wasted; while I'm behind on my marketing goals I am pretty much all set with learning game dev skills that I wanted to for this semester through the 3 game jams I've completed (strengthening game design on different types of game projects such as the Pumpkin Game Jam for a 3D game with Nikhil, trying a hand on mainly doing art, leading a team of smarter students than myself with the Berkeley jam, and trying just audio at the Turkey Jam), so now I can focus almost exclusively on marketing itself.</p>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Distributing time more evenly throughout the week while putting in more time per time spent on Game Design</p>
							</p>*Using more time going over tutorials (specifically for HTML, as most of my work is design-focused, thus I don't need to worry as much with Unity at the moment)</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research ideas (I should've done more research in this sprint)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website, continuously updating Blog Post formats, especially on recording videos of game development/progress</p>
							</p>*Still on learning more about Documentation styles, glad to see some of my work continuing to be featured for the Design Department</p>
							</p>*Spend MOST of my Sprint time the next two weeks on marketing, communication, and content.<p> <br> <br>
