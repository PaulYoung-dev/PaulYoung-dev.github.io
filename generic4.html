								</p>*</p>
							</p>MID-PRE-BETA 1--MID-PRE-BETA 2 RECAP:</p>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS:</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 18 Hours (for 3 Academic Credits 9 Hours Per Week, 9 Hours * 2 Weeks = 18 Hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint: 21 Hours (6 from Week 1 + 17 from Week 2 = 23 Hours)</p>
							</p>*By doing these extra 3 hours, I have successfully made up for the lost time from the prior Sprint (I was short 2.5 hours in the last sprint)</p>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>Again I do not have much video evidence, yet I have a plethora of image evidence in a pool of 1,500+ screenshots to draw upon to show my work. Next sprint I absolutely plan to use video evidence.<p>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:</p>
							</p>*Problem: Due to Scope Limitations, Had to re-work the Ultimate Dungeon Objective Design multiple times.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Recovering from the last Sprint's lack of time as well as having a very tough first week (I clutched U of M's first-ever Michigan Entrepreneurship Conference held by MPowered Entrepreneurship--UMich's Flagship Entrepreneurship Student Organization--by being brought on to help market product, help setup event logistics, lock down two of our speakers both on the days of the event, and moderate one of the speakers</p>
							</p>*Bug: I couldn't access the game with its latest changes. Fortunately got help from Game Director Brandon Schulz on 04/04/2021, and can playtest again.</p>
							</p>*Bug: After organizing my screenshot files for this website blog, some of my images disappeared from prior posts due to failing to update the code to pull them from their new locations (so currently the code has inaccurate information to draw the pictures from, and thus fails to display the images). I'll update the code for these changes soon so those images pop up again.</p>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*Planning ahead of time (I knew I'd be super busy the first week this week and that I needed extra hours because I was behind from last sprint and since my dungeon objective design is imperative for the studio by the end of this sprint)</p>
							</p>*Communicating when I needed help and not over-committing to more than I could do.</p>
							</p>*Having a strategy for how to create the Ultimate Dungeon Objective Design (first focusing on ideas, obtaining feedback from members, completing a draft version, communicating to figure out scope obstacles, rinse and repeat until had product at end of sprint)</p>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Ultimate Dungeon Objective Design (Super Success in my Mind, Very Complete and Feel Good About It)</p>
							</p>*Communication between multiple departments (got feedback, listened to, and incorporated ideas from each of the 4 departments)</p>
							</p>*Keeping up with WolverineSoft Studio hours and maintaining overall grades in heavy University of Michigan class courseload</p>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*Purusing a legendary Ultimate Dungeon Objective Design idea (would maximize the game's level-generator; nonetheless, despite its simple implementation, we decided against it since we felt that due to the short time left it would not have its due justice; to see what idea I'm talking about, look at idea #3 in the "(Ideas) Ultimate Dungeon Objective" document in Confluence).</p>
							</p>*Organizing screenshot image files for my website (this caused an inadvertant bug where many of my images disappeared, and I'll have to update the code; however, this time investment was still necessary for my website and organization of screenshots of work efforts in this project).</p>
							</p>*This week I strongly felt that my time was used wisely. That Ultimate Dungeon Objective Design is as good as it can get for this game in my opinion, barring minor changes to it in the upcoming sprint.</p>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Distributing time more evenly throughout the week (Failed this for the first week, nailed it for the second week of this sprint, confident I can continue this trend)</p>
							</p>*Using more time going over tutorials (specifically for HTML, still haven't gotten around to this much)</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research ideas (Succeeded in this sprint at this objective for Gameplay loops)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website, continuously updating Blog Post formats, this is still an urgent goal of mine</p>
							</p>*Still on learning more about Documentation styles, glad to see my work get featured again in this Sprint, definitely a confidence booster</p>
							</p>*Spend some of my Sprint time on specifically organizing past website progress (this is mega urgent now that I need to fix code to get prior post pictures back up again)<p> <br> <br>
