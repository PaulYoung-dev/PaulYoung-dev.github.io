										<p>*Feb. 21st - Monday: N/A</p>
										<p>*Feb. 22nd - Tuesday: N/A</p>
										<p>*Feb. 23rd - Wednesday: 2.5 Hours total,

										<p>*Feb. 24th - Thursday: 5.5 Hours total,
											I attended and was a speaker for the WolverineSoft Mass Meeting from 7pm-9pm ET. The topic I spoke about was "The Philosophy of Entrepreneurship". I prepared myself from 5:30-6:30pm ET for the presentation, finishing my slideshow and practicing what I would say and what discussion activities I would do.
											Overall I presented a 60-slide presentation covering 10+ basic entrepreneurship concepts from UM's ENTR 500 class, and related it to game development and how these tips are super helpful for any indie game development endeavors.
											The main point I drove home is that if one is going into indie game development then one needs to remember to build the company as well as the product.
											--
											I also attended and played an important role in our Project Bloom Design discussion from 9:15pm - 11:45pm ET. 
											Had Matthias--another Game Designer--and I not taken a stand about deciding the direction itself for Project Bloom I believe we would've had an even further project setback by at least a Sprint due to a lack of direction at all, and further if our raised points weren't realized in further Design discussions.

								</p>*</p>
							</p>PRE-ALPHA SPRINT 2 RECAP:</p>
							<br>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS:</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 12 Hours (for 4 Academic Credits 12 Hours Per Week, 12 Hours * 2 Weeks = 24 Hours; Total halved due to Spring Break)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint: 12+ hours (6.75 from Week 1 + 5.25+ from Week 2 = 12+ Hours)</p>
						<br>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>*For this Sprint I primarily have image evidence. As most of my marketing work dealt with words, I found image evidence to be the only type I need.<p>
						<br>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:</p>
							</p>*Problem: Due to taking on 23 credits I am recovering from a slow start to the school year.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Organizing marketing files so it can all be (more) in one place.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Time Management of Mid-terms and Extracurriculars, including WolverineSoft Studio time.</p>
							</p>*Problem: How to Decide which companies and individuals to search contact info for for Studio sponsorships.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Creating social media content--I need to get this rolling out soon.</p>
						<br>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*I used Spring Break to recover from getting behind in classes. How I did this was by studying, spending time on work, and resting up.</p>
							</p>*Implementing strategies I learned from my time during Startup Boston (such as using AirTable to quickly create and organize a social media post schedule))</p>
							</p>*I made sure to not forget to use Spring Break to rest up so I can be more productive consistently for the rest of the semester.</p>
							</p>*For this I read an article about what types of individuals to reach out to at larger companies; I then executed on this, using the Apollo software to search out people's emails.</p>
							</p>*I finally collected video footage for Bloom: Roots of Renewal, and still have GIFs of Ragnarok TD I made last semester. My plan is to use studio stuff from past semesters to springboard the social media accounts again, and to then use that momentum to further build awareness of what we're doing.</p>
						<br>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Creating an email contact list to soon reach out to. Hopefully we land some big-name sponsors soon! This positions the marketing of WolverineSoft Studio in a way to begin expansion of sponsorships.</p>
							</p>*Creating basic social media post content in Airtable workflow with 5 prepared social media posts to use. </p>
							</p>*Keeping up with the required WolverineSoft Studio hours this Sprint and maintaining overall grades in heavy University of Michigan class courseload (despite Midterm Exams and everything else I'm doing).</p>
							</p>*Applying leadership experience from my time with WolverineSoft Studio to a U-M student-founded game-dev studio (Bluebird Studios) as its primary strategic advisor.</p>
							</p>*Collected cool video clips for Bloom: Roots of Renewal to showcase game!</p>
						<br>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*Time spent creating this dev-blog (I need to find a quicker workflow for future semesters, and for future sprints this semester to not create this at the end of the week).</p>
							</p>*Time spent organizing and re-organizing marketing files/content.</p>
							</p>*I still overall don't feel like too much of my time was wasted, as I've repositioned myself from a slow start to this semester to now be able to run with the marketing for the next few sprints.</p>
						<br>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Distributing time more evenly throughout the week (Failed this sprint, yet shall try again, midterms is a pretty good excuse to me, yet I realize this happened to me during Winter 2021 also)</p>
							</p>*Using more time going over tutorials (specifically for marketing and sales tactics, while I have an unparalleled informal experience in them I am definitely not the best at professionalism or business acumen)</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research ideas (Thus far in the semester I have not researched enough about game mechanics or wildly successful marketing strategies seen in past examples with studios similar to ours)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website, continuously updating Blog Post formats, immediate focus on learning how to add/embed videos as well as record videos of game development/progress and updating regularly throughout the week as opposed to rushing it on a Sunday</p>
							</p>*DMing more people one-on-one, as I'm soon going to be featuring their work and want to make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime experience as I finish up my senior year of college in this awesome studio.</p>
