											I attended the IGDA Ann Arbor "Studio Sustainability / Entrepreneurship Panel" talk from 7:00pm - 9:15pm EST. <br>

											Unfortunately I missed the "Beyond Inheritance: The Composition Design Pattern" Talk by WolverineSoft Studio Advisor Austin Yarger earlier that day.
											<br>
											From 4:00pm to 5:00pm EST I created my tasks in Jira with descriptions, and decided what I needed to focus on for this Sprint, especially since it was getting towards the end of this week.
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Winter2022) Evidence/Pre-Alpha 2 (Feb. 21 - Mar. 6, 2022)/02-26/Screenshot (11111).png" alt="" /></span>

											From 8:00pm to 10:00pm EST I revitalized the social media schedule I had created for this schedule, updating it and creating social media pre-content. <br>
											I also created gameplay footage of Bloom: Roots of Renewal to be used as visual content for WolverineSoft Studio, since I had not recorded gameplay for that last semester since the game was still in progress.

										<p>*Mar. 2nd - Wednesday: N/A</p>
										<p>*Mar. 3rd - Thursday: N/A</p>
										<p>*Mar. 4th - Friday: 1.5 Hours Total <br> 
											From 6:30pm - 8:00pm EST I attended a Bluebird Studios dev-team meeting. I was recently onboarded to be an Adivsor & Strategist for Bluebird Studios, which was created by my friend from the U-M Entrepreneurs Leadership Program Chris Okumura.
											At this meeting we played a team-building game, did game design work for the current game "Treat Team", and I introduced the team to Jira.
											For this time I did not take screenshots.
										</p>
										<p>*Mar. 5th - Saturday: 3.5 Hours Total <br>
											From 8:30pm - 10:00pm EST I figured out how to set up Jira in a way to accomodate for all Treat Team progress and gave strategic advise to its founder based upon my WolverineSoft Studio and entrepreneurial experiences.

										</p>
										<p>*Mar. 6th - Sunday: 4.75 Hours total,
											From 11:00am - 11:30am EST I attended the general WolverineSoft Studio meeting virtually.

									</p>
								</p>*</p>
							</p>PRE-ALPHA SPRINT 2 RECAP:</p>
							<br>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS:</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 12 Hours (for 4 Academic Credits 12 Hours Per Week, 12 Hours * 2 Weeks = 24 Hours; Total halved from 24 down to 12 hours due to Spring Break, so final total this sprint is 12 hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint: 17.50 hours (7.75 from Week 1 + 9.75 from Week 2 = 17.50 Hours; this number is 14.50 hours if we don't include the time I spent applying my WolverineSoft Studio experiences with Bluebird Studios)</p>
						<br>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>*For this Sprint I primarily have image evidence, and some video evidence of the Bloom: Roots of Renewal gameplay content I made for future studio content posts. As most of my marketing work dealt with words, I found image evidence to be the only type I need.<p>
						<br>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:</p>
							</p>*Problem: Due to taking on 23 credits I am recovering from a slow start to the school year.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Organizing marketing files so it can all be (more) in one place.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Time Management of Mid-terms and Extracurriculars, including WolverineSoft Studio time.</p>
							</p>*Problem: How to Decide which companies and individuals to search contact info for for Studio sponsorships.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Creating social media content--I need to get this rolling out soon.</p>
						<br>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*I used Spring Break to recover from getting behind in classes. How I did this was by studying, spending time on work, and resting up.</p>
							</p>*Implementing strategies I learned from my time during Startup Boston (such as using AirTable to quickly create and organize a social media post schedule))</p>
							</p>*I made sure to not forget to use Spring Break to rest up so I can be more productive consistently for the rest of the semester.</p>
							</p>*For this I read an article about what types of individuals to reach out to at larger companies; I then executed on this, using the Apollo software to search out people's emails.</p>
							</p>*I finally collected video footage for Bloom: Roots of Renewal, and still have GIFs of Ragnarok TD I made last semester. My plan is to use studio stuff from past semesters to springboard the social media accounts again, and to then use that momentum to further build awareness of what we're doing.</p>
						<br>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Creating an email contact list to soon reach out to. Hopefully we land some big-name sponsors soon! This positions the marketing of WolverineSoft Studio in a way to begin expansion of sponsorships.</p>
							</p>*Creating basic social media post content in Airtable workflow with 5 prepared social media posts to use. </p>
							</p>*Keeping up with the required WolverineSoft Studio hours this Sprint and maintaining overall grades in heavy University of Michigan class courseload (despite Midterm Exams and everything else I'm doing).</p>
							</p>*Applying leadership experience from my time with WolverineSoft Studio to a U-M student-founded game-dev studio (Bluebird Studios) as its primary strategic advisor.</p>
							</p>*Collected cool video clips for Bloom: Roots of Renewal to showcase game!</p>
						<br>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*Time spent creating this dev-blog (I need to find a quicker workflow for future semesters, and for future sprints this semester to not create this at the end of the week).</p>
							</p>*Time spent organizing and re-organizing marketing files/content.</p>
							</p>*I still overall don't feel like too much of my time was wasted, as I've repositioned myself from a slow start to this semester to now be able to run with the marketing for the next few sprints.</p>
						<br>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Distributing time more evenly throughout the week (I did ok in this Sprint for this goal, yet shall try again; midterms is a pretty good excuse to me, yet I realize this happened to me during Winter 2021 and Fall 2021 a bit also)</p>
							</p>*Spending more time on creating content rather than improving workflows.</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research ideas about obtaining sponsorships and growing a social media presence organically.</p>
							</p>*Using more time on implementing marketing strategies now that basic structures (such as email contact list/etc.) are set in place</p>
							</p>*DMing more people one-on-one about studio progress, their work, and what work they want showcased when I create more social media content.</p>
