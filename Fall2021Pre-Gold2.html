							<p>This page contains my dev-blog information, where I break down my weekly hours, overall highlighting what I accomplished each week.</p>
							<p>Continue reading to see how my hours are broken down.</p>

								<p>Pre-Gold 2 (Dec. 6th - Dec. 12th, 2021)</p>
								<p>
		
								</p>
									<p>Week 1: 5.75 Total Work Hours
										<p>*Feb. 22nd - Monday: N/A</p>
										<p>*Feb. 23rd - Tuesday: N/A</p>
										<p>*Feb. 24th - Wednesday: 2.5 Hours total,
											I finished my grey-boxing attempt for the 1st Dungeon Objective. It even got featured in our group meeting for the start of Week 2 of this pre-Alpha II Sprint!
										</p>
                                        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Cloud Interior Pictures/FirstDODesignPic.PNG" alt="" /></span>
										<p>*Feb. 25th - Thursday: 1/2 Hour total,
											I slightly re-organized the Dungeon Objective documents (1 Main DO doc with 3 Branches, 1 branch for each DO, now which are in the "Old Dungeon Objective Iterations" Confluence branch), set up appointments with Brandon Schulz and Nikhil Ghosh for UI Design, and I looked at the preview sections for all the departments to stay updated on overall group progress.
										</p>
										<p>*Feb. 26th - Friday: 1 Hour total,
											I had a 1 hour meeting with Brandon Schulz and Nikhil Ghosh about UI Design, where I documented the "HUD Components" document and where we got to hear programming updates from Nikhil in general.
										</p>
										<p>*Feb. 27th - Saturday: N/A
										</p>
										<p>*Feb. 28th - Sunday: 1.75 Hours total,
											For 15 minutes I created and began the Design on the 2nd Dungeon Objective (now labeled "Old 2nd Dungeon Objective Iteration" in Confluence), and for an hour after that I attended the weekly WolverineSoft Studio meeting. For another half hour in the day I looked at previews, comments, and made some reactions, especially in the art-preview channel.</p>
                                            <p>Also my Dungeon Greybox got featured in our state of the game video!

								</p>*</p>
							</p>PRE-GOLD 2 SPRINT RECAP:</p>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS:</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 30 Hours (for 5 Academic Credits 15 Hours Per Week, 15 Hours * 2 Weeks = 30 Hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint: 30 Hours (? from Pre-Gold + ? from Gold Release = ? Hours)</p>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>*Currently I do not have video evidence, yet I have image evidence throughout this website. For next devblog post I plan to procure my best image/video evidence of results for the sprint in this section as well as throughout the website.<p>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED</p>
							</p>*Problem: Being busy with finals; I'm taking 20 credits and grading 2 classes this semester while working a part-time business job.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Finding a way to capture and observe itch.io rankings for our games the 48 hours after their releases.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Trying not to spam people too much the day during our game releases with social media and Discord announcements.</p>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*Solution: Prioritize tasks where others depend on me first (including WolverineSoft Studio), then tasks that will benefit me individually.</p>
							</p>*Solution: Capturing GIFs and photos like crazy after the 32 hour mark, then watching various game search categories on itch.io.</p>
							</p>*Solution: Space out posts throughout day, and use different social media platforms to not be annoying in one chat space for too long.</p>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Gathering itch.io rankings and organizing them on the WolverineSoft Studio Fall 2021 Airtable Workspace.</p>
							</p>*Gathering social media data and organizing it on the WolverineSoft Studio Fall 2021 Airtable Workspace.</p>
							</p>*Creating GIFs for the Ragnarok TD page. We got some pretty unique ones up there (my favorite--the one-life one! close second the 5-second wave one).</p>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*Trying to create more TikTok videos back-to-back-to-back. (Too many posts at once for that one)</p>
							</p>*Lack of time spent on HTML tutorials (still have much to learn with using HTML)</p>
							</p>*I still overall don't feel like too much of my time was wasted, especially as much of my work is creating long-term workflows, which means I might not have much immediate progress yet, yet I also think I got immediate progress this semester as well!</p>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Organizing social media schedule at beginning of each Sprint and having someone hold me accountable to stick to it.</p>
							</p>*Creating a similar Airtable (assuming Winter 2022) during Preproduction instead of Alpha 2 Sprint.</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research ideas (now for how to get the most views, impressions, and best algorithms for social medias)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website, overall cleaning up a lot of my work and further summarizing it.</p>
							</p>*Writing up my dev-blog entries DURING the sprints instead of waiting until the end (I do think I was better in Fall 2021 than Winter 2021 at this though).</p>
