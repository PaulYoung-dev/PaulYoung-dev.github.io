								<p>Pre-Gold 2 (Dec. 6th - Dec. 12th, 2021)</p>
								<p>
		
								</p>
									<p>Pre-Gold 2: ? Total Work Hours
										<p>*Dec. 6th - Monday: N/A</p>
										<p>*Dec. 7th - Tuesday: 0.5 hours total, 
											From 7:30pm - 8:00pm I made a post on LinkedIn with my personal account.
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Fall) Evidence/Pre-Gold 2 - Gold/Screenshot (10167).png" alt="" /></span>
										</p>
										<p>*Dec. 8th - Wednesday: N/A</p>
										<p>*Dec. 9th - Thursday: 2 Hours total,
											From 7:00pm - 9:00pm ET I attended the WolverineSoft general meeting. Here I gave my 10 minute speech followed by 5 minute Q&A for the Marketing Lead
											position with the WolverineSoft club for the 2022 cycle. We also celebrated our foundational officer team, many of whom are soon graduating.
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Fall) Evidence/Pre-Gold 2 - Gold/Screenshot (10167).png" alt="" /></span>
										</p>
										<p>*Dec. 10th - Friday: 15 Hours total,
											From 8:00am - 6:00pm ET I played our Gold build games to (and did) create 20+ Useable GIFs (and lots of failed recordings lol), 
											compressing them into 3MB file sizes for the absolute best ones to be used for the Ragnarok TD page and marketed 5+ Social posts across 3 media platforms 
											(LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok) using some of my social content videos from before. I made sure to get the word out so the Showcase event and games would be popular as they released.
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Fall) Evidence/Pre-Gold 2 - Gold/Screenshot (10167).png" alt="" /></span>
											<br>
											After watching our game trailers live on YouTube and taking a break from 7:00pm - 12:00am ET I attended the UM + EMU Student Games Showcase and played their various games.
											In this timeframe I also encouraged people to play/click/download/comment on/engage with our games.

										</p>
										<br>
										GOLD RELEASE
										<br>
										<p>*Dec. 11th - Saturday: N/A
											Throughout the day here and there I checked some of the itch.io page main stats for our games. I'm not counting any time for this day,
											yet I just had a bunch of miscellaneous conversations with team members/looking at stats/looking at some of the social media posts/etc.
										</p>
										<p>*Dec. 12th - Sunday: 7 Hours total,
											From 12:30am - 3:00am ET I created the Social Media data collection organization sheet on AirTable. This table contains the major metrics for all the posts I made for WolverineSoft Studio over this semester.
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Fall) Evidence/Pre-Gold 2 - Gold/Screenshot (10167).png" alt="" /></span>
											<br>
											From 9:30am - 12:00pm ET I screenshot'ed and GIF'ed as many itch categories that I could and wanted to record which showed our games' main stats on itch.io within 42 hours. 
											I checked briefly throughout the day after the 42 hour mark, yet only a few improvements in the data occurred between the 42 - 48 hour mark after game release for both games.
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/WolverineSoft (Fall) Evidence/Pre-Gold 2 - Gold/Screenshot (10167).png" alt="" /></span>
											<br>
											From 7:00pm - 9:00pm ET I attended the WolverineSoft Studio Fall 2021 Celebration Meeting! Events like these are going to be memories for life.

								</p>*</p>
							</p>PRE-GOLD 2 SPRINT RECAP:</p>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR PRE-GOLD 2 - GOLD RELEASE SPRINT: 24.5</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 15 Hours (for 5 Academic Credits 15 Hours Per Week, 15 Hours * 1 Week = 15 Hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint (Week): 24.5 (17.5 from Pre-Gold + 7 from Gold Release = 24.5 Hours)</p>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>*Most of my evidence this week is in the form of photos or GIFs.<p>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED</p>
							</p>*Problem: Being busy with finals; I'm taking 20 credits and grading 2 classes this semester while working a part-time business job.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Finding a way to capture and observe itch.io rankings for our games the 48 hours after their releases.</p>
							</p>*Problem: Trying not to spam people too much the day during our game releases with social media and Discord announcements.</p>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*Solution: Prioritize tasks where others depend on me first (including WolverineSoft Studio), then tasks that will benefit me individually.</p>
							</p>*Solution: Capturing GIFs and photos like crazy after the 32 hour mark, then watching various game search categories on itch.io.</p>
							</p>*Solution: Space out posts throughout day, and use different social media platforms to not be annoying in one chat space for too long.</p>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Gathering itch.io rankings and organizing them on the WolverineSoft Studio Fall 2021 Airtable Workspace.</p>
							</p>*Gathering social media data and organizing it on the WolverineSoft Studio Fall 2021 Airtable Workspace.</p>
							</p>*Creating GIFs for the Ragnarok TD page. We got some pretty unique ones up there (my favorite--the one-life one! close second the 5-second wave one).</p>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*Trying to create more TikTok videos back-to-back-to-back. (Too many posts at once for that one)</p>
							</p>*Lack of time spent on HTML tutorials (still have much to learn with using HTML)</p>
							</p>*I still overall don't feel like too much of my time was wasted, especially as much of my work is creating long-term workflows, which means I might not have much immediate progress yet, yet I also think I got immediate progress this semester as well!</p>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Organizing social media schedule at beginning of each Sprint and having someone hold me accountable to stick to it.</p>
							</p>*Creating a similar Airtable (assuming Winter 2022) during Preproduction instead of Alpha 2 Sprint.</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research ideas (now for how to get the most views, impressions, and best algorithms for social medias)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website, overall cleaning up a lot of my work and further summarizing it.</p>
							</p>*Writing up my dev-blog entries DURING the sprints instead of waiting until the end (I do think I was better in Fall 2021 than Winter 2021 at this though).</p>
