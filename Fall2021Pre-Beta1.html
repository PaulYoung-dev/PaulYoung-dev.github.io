								</p>*</p>
							</p>PRE-BETA 1 RECAP:</p>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS:</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 30 Hours (for 5 Academic Credits 15 Hours Per Week, 15 Hours * 2 Weeks = 30 Hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint: ? Hours (? from Week 1 + ? from Week 2 = ? Hours)</p>
							</p>*While my hours this week were under the ________.</p>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>*I do not have video evidence yet, but do have image, link, games, and file evidence to support my work endeavors.<p>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:</p>
							</p>*Problem: Narrative finding it's footing in Project Tower</p>
							</p>*Problem: Balancing other University of Michigan Extracurriculars with Game Design Time</p>
							</p>*Problem: Over-commitment (I did 2 game jams in 2 weekends in a row--with my busy schedule it's been pretty tough, but I am building my portfolio up))</p>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*Making sure I took on tasks and work that I enjoyed so I could power through such a busy schedule</p>
							</p>*Accepting more help from teammates in WolverineSoft Studio and my game jams than I normally would,
								including taking on a more limited role for the 2nd game jam by focusing only on audio.</p>
							</p>*Getting sleep instead of pulling all-nighters so while my work times were shorter they were more efficient generally.</p>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Ameliorating my devblog website so it is on track for being marketable (it looks MUCH better)!</p>
							</p>*Making sure I get game dev experience along with my marketing experience through persevering through 2 game jams in 2 consecutive weekends amidst a rigorous curriculum.</p>
							</p>*Overall maintaining University of Michigan grades and getting a lot done with WolverineSoft Studio despite some big time commitments with other extracurriculars and homework.</p>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*Many of my marketing plans and lacking to post as much content as I wanted to these past two weeks</p>
							</p>*Lack of time spent on HTML tutorials (still have much to learn with using HTML)</p>
							</p>*I still overall don't feel like too much of my time was wasted; while I'm behind on my marketing goals I am all set with learning game dev skills that I wanted to for this semester through the 3 game jams I've completed, so now I can focus almost exclusively on marketing itself.</p>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Distributing time more evenly throughout the week while putting in more time per time spent on Game Design</p>
							</p>*Using more time going over tutorials (specifically for HTML, as most of my work is design-focused, thus I don't need to worry as much with Unity at the moment)</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research ideas (I should've done more research in this sprint)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website, continuously updating Blog Post formats, especially on recording videos of game development/progress</p>
							</p>*Still on learning more about Documentation styles, glad to see some of my work continuing to be featured for the Design Department</p>
							</p>*Spend MOST of my Sprint time the next two weeks on marketing, communication, and content.<p> <br> <br>
