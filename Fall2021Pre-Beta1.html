								</p>*</p>
							</p>PRE-ALPHA 3--MID-PRE-BETA 1 RECAP:</p>
						</p>TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS:</p>
							</p>*Target Number of Hours: 30 Hours (for 5 Academic Credits 15 Hours Per Week, 15 Hours * 2 Weeks = 30 Hours)</p>
							</p>*Hours Achieved During this Sprint: ? Hours (? from Week 1 + ? from Week 2 = ? Hours)</p>
							</p>*While my hours this week were under the required 18, I made up for them in the next sprint where it mattered more.</p>
						</p>IMAGE AND VIDEO EVIDENCE</p>
							</p>*I do not have video evidence yet, but do have image evidence.<p>
						</p>BUGS AND PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:</p>
							</p>*Problem: Due to Scope Limitations, Have to Re-Design Dungeon Objective Designs and Plans Again</p>
							</p>*Problem: Balancing other University of Michigan Extracurriculars with Game Design Time</p>
							</p>*Problem: Over-commitment (occasionally I communicated that I would do something and then didn't or did so late, under-estimating the workload I had during these weeks)</p>
						</p>TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED:</p>
							</p>*More distribution of work throughout week</p>
							</p>*Getting help when I needed it (getting the playtesting setup on my computer)</p>
							</p>*New documentation organization strategies (with the Dungeon Objective Cheat Sheet, I didn't overthink it, I just did it)</p>
						</p>SUCCESSFUL TASKS:</p>
							</p>*Dungeon Objective Cheat Sheet (Nailed it! Super straightforward and concise)</p>
							</p>*Revamped Dungeon Objective Documentation (These all had similar style, feel, and in my opinion were very well designed)</p>
							</p>*Overall maintaining University of Michigan grades and getting a lot done with WolverineSoft Studio despite some big time commitments with other extracurriculars and homework.</p>
						</p>UNSUCCESSFUL TIME INVESTMENTS:</p>
							</p>*The Revamped Dungeon Objective Designs (they were great, yet due to more scope reductions these also ultimately are scrapped)</p>
							</p>*Lack of time spent on HTML tutorials (still have much to learn with using HTML)</p>
							</p>*I still overall don't feel like too much of my time was wasted, if anything I wish I had put more time into the project during this sprint</p>
						</p>STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING IN FUTURE SPRINTS:</p>
							</p>*Distributing time more evenly throughout the week while putting in more time per time spent on Game Design</p>
							</p>*Using more time going over tutorials (specifically for HTML, as most of my work is design-focused, thus I don't need to worry as much with Unity at the moment)</p>
							</p>*Using more time to research ideas (I should've done more research in this sprint)</p>
							</p>*Continuing to format this website, continuously updating Blog Post formats, especially on recording videos of game development/progress</p>
							</p>*Still on learning more about Documentation styles, glad to see some of my work continuing to be featured for the Design Department</p>
							</p>*Spend some of my Sprint time polishing my blog posts from the past.<p> <br> <br>
